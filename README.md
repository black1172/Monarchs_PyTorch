# Initial thoughts
-going to use 'habitat suitability' as opposed to detecing actual indivdual milkweed plants etc. per Wiley Online Library
-Rationale for project is personal passion for protecting and surveying our enviroment through technology, I plant lots of milkweed in my yard and am passionate about monarch conservation as well.
